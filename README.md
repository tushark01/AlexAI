# Streamlit QnA Chatbot

This project implements a Question-and-Answer (QnA) chatbot using Streamlit and the LLAMA Index framework. The chatbot leverages the OpenAI GPT-4 model to provide answers to user questions based on information extracted from a given PDF book.

## Features

- **Streamlit Interface**: The chatbot is presented through a Streamlit interface, making it easy to interact with.
- **QnA Capabilities**: It can answer user questions based on the content of a provided PDF book.
- **Conversational Context**: The chatbot maintains a conversation history and can handle follow-up questions.
- **Personalization**: It greets users by name and incorporates their name into responses when appropriate.
- **Informative Messages**: If a user's question cannot be answered based on the provided context, the chatbot politely informs them and suggests rephrasing or providing additional context.
